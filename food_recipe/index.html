      <h3>About My Favorite Food</h3>
      <p>
        My fabvorite meal is <strong>Jollof Rice</strong> a popular West-African
        dish <br />
        Jollof rice is one of the most popular foods in West Africa, although
        the ingredients <br />
        and methods of preparation vary from location to region, the dish is
        often made in a single <br />
        pot with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, spices, vegetables, and
        meat.
      </p>
      <h5>Origin</h5>
      <p>
        The origins of jollof rice can be traced to the Senegambian region that
        was ruled by the Wolof or <br />
        Jolof Empire in the 14th century, spanning parts of today's Senegal, The
        Gambia and Mauritania, <br />
        where rice was grown. The dish has its roots in a traditional dish
        called thieboudienne, containing <br />
        rice, fish, shellfish and vegetables. <br />
        Food and agriculture historian James C. McCann <br>
        considers this claim plausible given the popularity of rice in the upper Niger <br>
        valley, but considers it unlikely that the dish could have spread from Senegal <br>
        to its current range since such a diffusion is not seen in "linguistic, historical or political patterns".
